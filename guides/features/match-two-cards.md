Instructions - Match Two Cards
--

### Overview

In this feature, you will want to create a skeleton of elements with any additional child elements that will make up the project you are creating.

- In an `index.html` file, your `<body>` will have three main sections:
  - `<header>`, will be used for a heading and/or logo.
  - `<aside>`, will be used to hold data / information regarding game stats.
  - `<main>`, will be used to hold the cards to play through your Memory Match game.

<!-- TODO Will have design docs located here -->


### After each challenge

- When your feature implementation is complete, you will want to save and submit your work to the branch that you have created.
  - Use `git status` to check that you are on the correct branch that represents your feature.
  - You will want to **add**, **commit**, and **push** the code that you have written to the appropriate Github repository.
    1. `git add .`
    2. `git commit -m "Description of the feature that you have implemented"`
       - e.g. `git commit -m "Added simple HTML skeleton"`
    3. `git push origin FEATURE_NAME_HERE`
       - e.g. `git push origin skeleton`

- Finally, you will want to create a pull request. This will merge the code from your newly **completed** feature branch into your `master` branch.
