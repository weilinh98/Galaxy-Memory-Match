Instructions - Win Condition
--

### Overview

In this feature, a fourth card will be used to complete the base functionality of this project to "win" the game. We will be accomplishing this by matching two pairs of cards and displaying a modal.

<details>
   <summary>What is a modal?</summary>
      A <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_modals.asp" target="_blank">modal</a> is a dialog bopopup window that is displayed on top of the current page.
</details>

### Feature Set

1. In your `index.html`, uncomment another card.
   - There should now be a total of four cards displaying on the page.
2. In your `script.js`, introduce another variable:
   - `total_matches`
3. After each successful match of the two cards you have clicked, check your `matches` variable with the `total_matches` variable.
   - If true, display the modal to verify that there is a "win". This will now complete the game.
   - If false, nothing happens, the user will continue playing the game.

### After Each Feature

- When your feature implementation is complete, you will want to save and submit your work to the branch that you have created.
  - Use `git status` to check that you are on the correct branch that represents your feature.
  - You will want to **add**, **commit**, and **push** the code that you have written to the appropriate Github repository.
    1. `git add .`
    2. `git commit -m "Description of the feature that you have implemented"`
       - e.g. `git commit -m "Added simple HTML skeleton"`
    3. `git push origin FEATURE_NAME_HERE`
       - e.g. `git push origin skeleton`

- Finally, you will want to create a pull request. This will merge the code from your newly **completed** feature branch into your `master` branch.

  1. Navigate to <kbd>New Pull Request</kbd>:
